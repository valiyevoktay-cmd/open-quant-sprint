# Known limits of the audit (v1.2)

The audit is built to catch honest look-ahead mistakes. It is not a security boundary. These gaps are
known; the official verdict protocol in `RULES.md` is designed around them.

## A strategy is ordinary Python

- Each call runs in a separate process from an empty directory, but the process can still read files
  and open network connections. A strategy that reads the dataset from disk can see the future.
- Block [13] of the report flags common patterns (`shift(-k)`, file reads, imports of the harness).
  It is a regex scan and is easy to evade, so it does not affect the verdict.
- The process can also inspect its own call stack and memory. Up to audit v1.1 the bar-by-bar
  evaluation sent the whole holdout or forward period to the strategy process at once, so a strategy
  could read later bars from the evaluator's variables while the leak check still reported no leak.
  Since v1.2 the process is sent one bar at a time and receives the next bar only after it returns
  weights; the canary `tests/fixtures/frame_peek.py` must stay rejected.
- Mitigation: every strategy is read by the maintainer. A forward runner without network access and
  without the data files is in progress (see `RULES.md`); until it is in place, the reading is the
  only guard against file and network access.

## Causality is tested on a finite set of cuts

- Weights are compared on the last full bar, five fixed prefixes and eight random ones. A leak that
  is active only on a few hours can miss all random cuts in a single run, so re-running CI can turn a
  REJECT into a PASS.
- Mitigation: the official run uses 60 random cuts. The seed is printed so any run can be reproduced.
- Two canaries in `tests/fixtures/` (`tail_peek.py`, `known_cuts_peek.py`) reproduce the leaks that
  passed audit v1.0 and must stay rejected.

## CI is not the referee

- A pull request runs the workflow file from its own branch, so a PR that edits `.github/` can change
  what CI checks. Changes outside `strategies/` and `src/contrib/` need maintainer review
  (`.github/CODEOWNERS`, enforced through branch protection on `main`).
- A green CI run is therefore not a verdict; the maintainer's run is.

## Statistics

- PASS means causal, reproducible and positive after costs, not an edge: 7 % of random combinations of
  standard causal features pass, none with a bootstrap interval above zero.
- 95 % interval half-widths are about +-1.5 Sharpe points on the training panel, +-6 on the 36-day
  holdout and +-9 on the 14-day forward period. Final results are not ranked.
- The holdout (Sep 12 - Oct 18) is public Binance data and could have been studied before the freeze.
  Only the forward period is sealed.
- The number of variants a participant tried is not recorded, so the Deflated Sharpe uses an assumed
  number of trials.
